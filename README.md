# Computer-Vision

Contains work done for the Comp Vision project.

In the SVM-Image-Recognition directory is a project that uses a SVM implementation that classifies mouses vs cows, images from the "Animal Faces" dataset.

In the Labs directory there are three small exercises that use open-cv library:

  1. Adding a transparent logo over a live feed image(camera).
  2. Making a shape color fill with forward-fill.
  3. Corner detection using erode&dilate morphological operations and structuring elements.
